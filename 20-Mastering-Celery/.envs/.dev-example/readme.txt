To ensure proper configuration, please adjust the environmental variables and rename folders as follows:
- Rename the folder **.envs/.dev-example** to **.envs/.dev**
- Set all environmental variables specific to your project's requirements within .envs/.dev.
- Current values serve as examples and might not function properly.

This step ensures that your project is configured correctly with the appropriate environmental settings.

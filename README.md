# Mastering_Django_through_Projects
Mastering Django through Projects is a comprehensive repository that offers a series of Django projects that I have created. This repository is designed to help developers improve their skills and knowledge of the Django framework. The repository contains a range of projects that cover different aspects of Django, from basic RESTful API development to full-stack development. </br>
Each project in the repository is designed to increase in difficulty, providing a structured and progressive learning experience. The projects are built with Django and Django REST framework and cover a variety of topics such as API development, back-end development, and full-stack development. By completing these projects, you can gain a deeper understanding of Django, including its architecture, best practices, and how to effectively use it to build robust and scalable web applications. Additionally, you can develop skills in testing and debugging. </br>
The API projects, in particular, are designed to be RESTful, adhering to best practices and industry standards. This repository is meant for experienced developers looking to hone their skills. Mastering Django through Projects is an excellent resource for anyone looking to improve their Django knowledge and become a more effective Django developer.</br>

## 01-Restaurant-Webpage-Django
This is a restaurant website built with Django, a popular Python-based web framework. The website consists of four pages: Home, Menu, Book, and About.</br>
On the Home page, users can view an overview of the restaurant, including information about the cuisine and atmosphere. The Menu page displays all the dishes offered at the restaurant, with links to detailed descriptions and photos of each dish.</br>
The Book page allows users to make a reservation at the restaurant. They can select the number of people in their party, and any special requests they may have. The website uses Django's built-in forms to collect and validate user input.</br>
The About page provides a description of the restaurant and its owner, including their philosophy, history, and community involvement.</br>
The website is built using Django and uses Django messages to display feedback to users after they submit a form. The front end is styled with CSS and features nicely styled HTML.</br>
The data for the website is stored in a database. The owner of the restaurant can create a superuser account and use the Django admin panel to add menu items and manage bookings made through the website. They can view the bookings made by users. Overall, this is a simple but effective restaurant website that provides users with a seamless experience when booking a table or exploring the menu.</br>
